            <h1>Founder</h1>
            <p>Tom brings to the Board a wealth of educational and recreational experience, as well as a combined time in the Galapagos Islands of over one year. Graduating with a Master of Science degree in Zoology, he taught Biology, Earth Science, and Marine Biology for over 40 years in the public schools of Arizona. His teaching experience also includes nearly 32 years with the Arizona Army National Guard, retiring as the Director of Non-commissioned Officer education in 2002, with the rank of Command Sergeant Major. Establishing the Galapagos Marine Ecology course for the University of Arizona in 2003 and continuing to teach a continuing education course for the University of San Diego in the Galapagos Islands, Mr. Lutz continues to be actively involved in Galapagos. He has also sponsored two Galapagos students as exchange students to the United Stated for a period of nearly 6 years, along with bringing several other students from Galapagos to visit Arizona and Southern California since 2006. Serving as a volunteer leader in Young Life for nearly 25 years, Tom has maintained a strong commitment to students of the United States and the Galapagos Islands. He has also worked in non-profit foundations since 2003.</p>
